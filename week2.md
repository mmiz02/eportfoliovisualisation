# Week 2 - Exploring Website Visualisation Principles and Beginning the Discussion Forum

During Week 2, I began the discussion forum task comparing the Ryanair and EasyJet websites. This activity encouraged me to analyse how both companies use visual design to communicate key information such as destinations, flight prices, and promotional offers. Creating the initial post allowed me to apply theoretical concepts from our module to real-world interfaces and to consider how effective data visualisation can enhance user experience.

## Learning from the Lecturecast:
In this week’s Lecturecast, I learned more about the principles of data visualisation, particularly how visual variables such as colour, length, shape, size, and position are used to encode and differentiate data (Cairo, 2016). Understanding these principles helped me identify why EasyJet’s use of a balanced orange-and-white colour palette appears cleaner and more user-friendly, whereas Ryanair’s bold blue and yellow scheme draws attention but can feel visually dense. I also learned how visual hierarchy, alignment, and consistency support quicker information processing — all of which are critical in web-based visualisations.

## Reflection:
This week improved my ability to link theory with practice. I can now more critically evaluate websites not just in terms of usability but also in terms of data communication. Next week, I plan to build on this by engaging with my peers’ posts to explore different perspectives on visual design effectiveness.
