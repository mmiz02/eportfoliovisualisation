## Week 1 - LectureCast and Case Study

# Aim: To introduce myself to this module and understand the value of data visualisation in storytelling and analysis.

# Activities
Went through the lecturecast "Principles of Data Visualisation". Learnt about the importance of narrative in data storytelling and the importance of visualising data since humans are first and foremost visual creatures. 
- Learnt about different approaches to visualisation, eg: Explanatory, Exhibitory, and Exploratory.
- Compared Python vs Tableau
- Compared Data Visualisation vs Business Analytics

Apart from the lecturecast, I completed the case study: *"Mike Bostock's "Across U.S. Companies, Tax Rates Vary Greatly*" (The New York Times). By Hovering on the data points visualised by Bostock, I could easily view different companies' tax rates, earnings, and amount of tax paid. The companies were grouped by colour, depending on their effective tax rates. The companies were depicted by circles, sized depending by its market capitalisation. I also had the option to change my viewing option and view the companies by industry, for example Pharma, Utilities, and Information Technology. The image may be viewed below:

I answered and reflected on guided questions about corporate tax variation.

# Case Study Reflection
Article: Across U.S. Companies, Tax Rates Vary Greatly - Mike Bostock, The New York Times

Variation of corporate tax:
The visualisation showed significant variation in corporate tax rates across industries. Some large tech companies and multinationals appeared to pay lower effective tax rates than smaller, more localised firms.

Companies paying less vs high tax:
Inudstries such as technology and pharmaceuticals often paid less due to offshore subsidiaries and tax incentives, while retailers and utilities tended to pay higher effective rates because they operate mostly within domestic markets.

Reasons some companies pay less:
- Tax loopholes and foreign income deferrals
- Use of tax havens
- R & D credits and government incentives

Interesting discoveries:
Even within the same industry, tax rates varied widely, reflecting corporate structure and accounting strategy. The visualisation effectively used colour and layout to show not just values, but patterns of inequality in the tax system. It demonstrated how data visualisation can expose systemic differences in corporate behaviour that raw numbers alone might hide.

# Skills Learned
- Understanding the power and key principles of effective visualisation
- Recognising how visual storytelling enhances data communication.
- Exploring visualisation tools used in data science and machine learning (e.g., Tableau, Power BI, D3.js, Python libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly).
- Interpreting and evaluating visualisation in real-world journalism.

# Reflection
This session highlighted how visualisations can transform complex datasets into accessible stories. Bostock's work demonstrated the power of design and interactivity to make data meaningful. I realised that effective visualisation isn't just about showing data, it's about communicating insight clearly and ethically.

# Going forward, I aim to:
- Apply visualisation tools such as position, color, and size encodings more deliberately.
- Critcally evaluate tool capabilities when choosing platforms for data storytelling.



Applied understanding of different visualization tools and assessed how they reveal insights in real datasets.
