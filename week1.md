## Week 1 - LectureCast and Case Study

# Aim: To introduce myself to this module and understand the value of data visualisation in storytelling and analysis.

# Activities
Went through the lecturecast "Principles of Data Visualisation". Learnt about the importance of narrative in data storytelling and the importance of visualising data since humans are first and foremost visual creatures. 
- Learnt about different approaches to visualisation, eg: Explanatory, Exhibitory, and Exploratory.
- Compared Python vs Tableau
- Compared Data Visualisation vs Business Analytics

Apart from the lecturecast, I completed the case study: *"Mike Bostock's "Across U.S. Companies, Tax Rates Vary Greatly*" (The New York Times). By Hovering on the data points visualised by Bostock, I could easily view different companies' tax rates, earnings, and amount of tax paid. The companies were grouped by colour, depending on their effective tax rates. The companies were depicted by circles, sized depending by its market capitalisation. I also had the option to change my viewing option and view the companies by industry, for example Pharma, Utilities, and Information Technology.

I answered and reflected on guided questions about corporate tax variation.

Article: Across U.S. Companies, Tax Rates Vary Greatly — Mike Bostock, The New York Times

Variation of corporate tax:
The visualization showed significant variation in corporate tax rates across industries. Some large tech companies and multinationals appeared to pay lower effective tax rates than smaller, more localized firms.

Companies paying less vs. high tax:
Industries such as technology and pharmaceuticals often paid less due to offshore subsidiaries and tax incentives, while retailers and utilities tended to pay higher effective rates because they operate mostly within domestic markets.

Reasons some companies pay less:

Tax loopholes and foreign income deferrals

Use of tax havens

R&D credits and government incentives

Interesting discoveries:

Even within the same industry, tax rates varied widely, reflecting corporate structure and accounting strategy.

The visualization effectively used color and layout to show not just values, but patterns of inequality in the tax system.

It demonstrated how data visualization can expose systemic differences in corporate behavior that raw numbers alone might hide.

🧠 Skills Learned

Understanding the grammar of graphics and key principles of effective visualization.

Recognizing how visual storytelling enhances data communication.

Exploring visualization tools used in data science and machine learning (e.g., Tableau, Power BI, D3.js, Python libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly).

Interpreting and evaluating visualizations in real-world journalism.🤔 Reflection

This session highlighted how visualizations can transform complex datasets into accessible stories. Bostock’s work demonstrated the power of design and interactivity to make data meaningful. I realized that effective visualization isn’t just about showing data — it’s about communicating insight clearly and ethically.

Going forward, I aim to:

Apply visualization grammar (like position, color, and size encodings) more deliberately.

Critically evaluate tool capabilities when choosing platforms for data storytelling.

Consider both technical accuracy and narrative engagement in my future visualizations.

🎓 Learning Outcomes

Critically evaluated the grammar and idioms of data visualization through practical analysis.

Applied understanding of different visualization tools and assessed how they reveal insights in real datasets.
