** Week 8: Programming Exercise **

In Week 8, I worked on a substantial assignment focused on developing data-driven classification models to support a bank’s telemarketing campaigns. The task involved analysing a real-world dataset from a Portuguese bank, containing customer, campaign, and socio-economic attributes, with the aim of predicting whether a customer would subscribe to a long-term deposit product.

The first part of the assignment required a thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA). I used a range of visualisation techniques to explore variable distributions, categorical features, missing data, and relationships between variables. This helped me better understand the structure of the data and identify features that were potentially influential for the classification task, such as contact type, campaign intensity, and economic indicators. The lecturecast reinforced the importance of selecting the right visualisation approach for machine learning tasks, particularly when the goal is to support interpretation rather than simply present data.

The second part focused on statistical modelling, where I applied different classifiers covered in the module and visualised their performance. Using visual tools such as confusion matrices and ROC curves allowed me to compare models and interpret trade-offs between recall, precision, and overall accuracy. This aligned closely with earlier weeks, where visualisation was used to support decision-making in classification problems.

The feedback I received highlighted solid performance across knowledge, analysis, and critical evaluation, resulting in an overall mark of 68. However, it also identified key areas for improvement. In particular, the submission of code in the correct format was missing, and the structure and presentation of the report could have been more clearly organised from general to specific. Reflecting on this, I recognise that technical correctness alone is not sufficient; clarity, reproducibility, and professional presentation are essential components of effective data analysis.

In addition, I independently researched alternative visualisation techniques, such as sunburst charts, to explore hierarchical relationships in categorical data. Although I ultimately chose other visualisations that I felt better communicated my findings, this process helped me critically evaluate which charts were most appropriate for explaining results to a non-technical audience.

Overall, Week 8 strengthened my understanding of how EDA, model visualisation, and careful presentation work together to support meaningful machine learning analysis. It also highlighted the importance of aligning visualisation choices with both the analytical task and the intended audience, which is a key takeaway for future applied data science projects.
