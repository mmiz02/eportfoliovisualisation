**Formative Activity - The Future of Data Visualisation - Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR)**

Focusing on the future of data visualisation, the rise of using AR/VR technologies appears imminent. After researching these technologies, I reflected on how these could be helpful visualisation aids in my line of work as a radiation protection regulator. Traditionally, I rely on two-dimensional charts and spreadsheets, that don't always manage to convey the message which I got from the data and not all spatial or temporal relationships can be fully embedded in the visualisation. This means that I have to include more visualisations, which is often more confusing than helpful.

The readings highlighted how immersive technologies can enhance understanding by allowing users to interact with data in a more intuitive way. Nichols (2019) discusses how VR enables users to “step inside” data, which I believe could be particularly valuable when assessing radiation dose distributions across facilities or environments. Being able to visualise exposure levels in three dimensions may help identify patterns or risk areas that are less obvious in standard visualisations.

From a practical perspective, AR has clear potential mostly during training. Such training would be interactive, allowing one to construct rooms with controlled area boundires, hielding, learn about primary and secondary scatter, etc. It could also be used as training for licensees which is practical and hands-on, keeping them interested (which is very important). They may be taught about safety violations and radiation hazards using VR. This may also help standardise radiation safety understanding across entities.

One must bare in mind Kurbatov’s (2017) discussion of the human factor, recognising the importance of designing such visualisations carefully to avoid cognitive overload, particularly in high-risk environments where clarity is critical.

Overall, I don't see the need for such visualisations as applied to my job directly but I'm certain that many other professions will benefit from AR and VR, especialy when it comes to training, stakeholder engagement, and risk communication, which may help bridge the gap between technical data and public understanding.

**Reflective Entry: Week 12 – Future of Data Visualisation and Final Dashboard Project**

Week 12 required me to simultaneously reflect on the future direction of data visualisation and complete a major summative dashboard assignment. Together, these activities highlighted a clear tension between aspirational visualisation approaches and my current practical limitations.

The formative activity on AR and VR in data visualisation prompted me to think beyond traditional two-dimensional charts and dashboards. Reflecting on my professional context as a radiation protection regulator, I recognised the limitations of static visualisations for communicating complex spatial and temporal relationships. The literature reinforced this perspective, particularly in showing how immersive technologies can support more intuitive understanding by allowing users to interact with data in three dimensions. While I see strong potential for AR and VR in areas such as site inspections, training, and risk communication, I also became more aware of the cognitive and design challenges involved. This activity helped me critically assess not just what could be done with emerging technologies, but what should be done to ensure clarity, safety, and effective communication.

Alongside this, I completed the final dashboard assignment based on the ASOS sales performance use case, building on the wireframe and feedback from Unit 9. I made a conscious effort to address earlier criticisms by more clearly identifying stakeholders, defining the purpose of the dashboard, and justifying metric selection. I also paid greater attention to design fundamentals such as colour consistency, typography, layout, and visual hierarchy. Preparing an executive summary, technical design report, and user manual forced me to articulate and defend my design choices more explicitly than in earlier work.

However, despite these improvements, the outcome still reflected ongoing limitations. The dashboard was again produced using Canva, which constrained interactivity, reproducibility, and analytical depth. Although the structure of the work improved, feedback indicated that the logical flow and critical engagement with sources remained limited. Receiving the same overall mark (60) as in Unit 9 was particularly instructive: while I demonstrated progression in planning and reflection, this did not translate into a substantial improvement in assessed performance.

Critically, this week made it clear that incremental design improvements are not sufficient without parallel development of technical and analytical skills. My continued reliance on design-led tools rather than programmatic or BI platforms suggests a reluctance to fully engage with more demanding technical workflows, often justified by time constraints. This has become a recurring pattern across the module and is an area that requires deliberate change.

Overall, Week 12 consolidated many of the module’s themes—stakeholder-driven design, critical visual justification, and the evolving landscape of data visualisation—but also exposed persistent weaknesses in depth, structure, and technical execution. While I have developed a stronger conceptual understanding of effective visualisation and its future directions, the key learning outcome from this week is the need to move beyond comfort-driven tool choices and to more rigorously integrate analytical, technical, and critical perspectives in future work.
