**Formative Activity - The Future of Data Visualisation - Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR)**

Focusing on the future of data visualisation, the rise of using AR/VR technologies appears imminent. After researching these technologies, I reflected on how these could be helpful visualisation aids in my line of work as a radiation protection regulator. Traditionally, I rely on two-dimensional charts and spreadsheets, that don't always manage to convey the message which I got from the data and not all spatial or temporal relationships can be fully embedded in the visualisation. This means that I have to include more visualisations, which is often more confusing than helpful.

The readings highlighted how immersive technologies can enhance understanding by allowing users to interact with data in a more intuitive way. Nichols (2019) discusses how VR enables users to “step inside” data, which I believe could be particularly valuable when assessing radiation dose distributions across facilities or environments. Being able to visualise exposure levels in three dimensions may help identify patterns or risk areas that are less obvious in standard visualisations.

From a practical perspective, AR has clear potential during site inspections. Overlaying real-time radiation readings or regulatory limits onto physical spaces could improve situational awareness and support more informed regulatory decisions. Reflecting on Kurbatov’s (2017) discussion of the human factor, I recognise the importance of designing such visualisations carefully to avoid cognitive overload, particularly in high-risk environments where clarity is critical.

Looking ahead, I can see AR and VR being especially valuable for training, stakeholder engagement, and risk communication. These technologies could help bridge the gap between technical data and public understanding, supporting transparency and trust in regulatory decisions. Overall, this activity has highlighted how immersive visualisation tools, when applied thoughtfully, could complement existing analytical approaches and enhance the effectiveness of radiation protection regulation.
