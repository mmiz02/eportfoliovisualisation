**Week 10: Using Tableau**

Week 10 introduced Tableau as a business intelligence tool designed to support rapid, non-programmatic data visualisation. One of the key strengths highlighted this week was Tableau’s ability to produce polished and interactive visual outputs with minimal technical overhead, making it highly accessible to business users without a programming background.

Through the introductory videos and practical exercises, I learned how to navigate the Tableau interface, connect to different data sources, and create basic visual displays such as bar charts, line charts, and dashboards. Features such as sorting, grouping, and formatting demonstrated how visual analytics can be used to quickly explore trends and support operational decision-making. This contrasted with earlier weeks where visualisation required more time-intensive, code-based workflows in R or Python.

However, while Tableau’s ease of use is a clear advantage, this week also made its limitations more apparent when viewed critically. Compared to programming-based tools, Tableau offers less transparency in how transformations are applied and weaker support for fully reproducible analytical workflows. This reinforced the importance of tool selection based on context: Tableau is well-suited for rapid business reporting and stakeholder communication, but less appropriate for complex modelling or research-driven analysis.

Reflecting on my engagement this week, I recognise that although I completed the exercises, I approached them more procedurally than critically. I focused on learning how to produce visualisations rather than why specific visual or analytical choices were most appropriate. This mirrors a broader pattern identified in earlier weeks, where time constraints led me to prioritise completion over deeper evaluation.

Overall, Week 10 strengthened my understanding of industry-standard BI tools and clarified how Tableau fits within the wider data visualisation ecosystem. It also highlighted the need for a more critical and intentional approach when using drag-and-drop tools, ensuring that ease of use does not replace analytical rigour or thoughtful design.
