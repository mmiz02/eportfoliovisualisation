# Title: Engaging with Peer Discussions and Deepening My Understanding of Visualisation Design

## This Week’s Focus:
In Week 3, I engaged with my peers’ discussion posts comparing the Ryanair and EasyJet websites. Reading and responding to their analyses helped me see how different perspectives can highlight nuances in data visualisation and web interface design that I initially overlooked. While my own post focused on usability and colour contrast, my peers drew attention to other important elements such as visual density, map interactivity, and the cognitive load caused by overlapping routes and excessive on-screen details.

## What I Learned:
Through these interactions, I developed a deeper understanding of the balance between clarity and interactivity in visual design. For instance, I learned that while interactivity can improve engagement, it can also introduce complexity if not paired with visual hierarchy and filtering options (Cairo, 2016). Additionally, Munzner’s (2014) concept of marks and channels became clearer as I analysed how each website uses colour, shape, and position to encode flight and destination data. Discussing these theories in relation to real-world websites made abstract design principles more concrete and practical.

## Reflection:
Responding to my peers reinforced the importance of constructive feedback in the learning process. It encouraged me to think critically about not only what information is shown but how it is represented visually. Moving forward, I aim to apply these insights to future data visualisation projects, ensuring that design decisions enhance clarity without compromising interactivity.
