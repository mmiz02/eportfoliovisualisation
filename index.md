### About Me
Currently working as a Radiation Protection Regulator with the Radiation Protection Commission in Malta. Pursuing a Master's in Data Science with the University of Essex, I'm passionate about deriving insights from data and hope to be able to apply it to guide future regulatory decisions to improve public and environmental safety.

This portfolio showcases a selection of tasks and projects from this module along with a Reflective essay, outlining my learning journey and key takeaways.

We'll see how it goes!!
This e-portfolio has significantly contributed to my professional and personal growth. Professionally, I strengthened technical skills in Python, SQL, GitHub, and database design, while gaining practical experience in data governance, compliance, and automation skills, which is directly relevant to my role as a Radiation Protection Regulator. Collaborative projects enhanced my teamwork, communication, and project management abilities. On a personal level, I also improved my independency and built confidence in problem-solving and critical thinking.
