**Week 4: Finalising the discussion**

During this week, I was required to finalise the three-week long discussion. Unfortunately, I was unable to complete this task within the given timeframe. This experience has highlighted weaknesses in my time management and planning, whilst also providing valuable insight into how I can improve my approach to coursework moving forward.
 
A key factor contributing to this issue was underestimating the amount of time required to meaningfully engage with the discussion content. The reading amount as well as the R practice sets further limited the time I could dedicate to this module during that period. Nevertheless, I got the opportunity to improve my R skills , for example tidying and filtering data, and handling missing units.


Reflecting on this, I recognise that more effective time management strategies could have prevented this situation. In particular by dividing the week's work load appropriately throughout the week and not have huge workloads at a time. additionally, prioritising tasks based on their weighting and deadlines would have allowed me to better balance my workload.

Despite not completing the task in time, I still interacted with my peer's comments and learnt a lot from this discussion. My peer brought to my attention how I had not been detailed enough in my suggestions. This feedback made me aware of the importance of being specific when contributing to discussions. As a result, I feel more confident supporting my recommendations in future discussions with concrete explanations and deeper views.
